==============================

This dataset is adapted from the paper: https://linusnep.github.io/EnvoDat/ . 
You can use the dataset to train state of the art computer vision models.

The dataset includes 1000 images. Object and terrain classes are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

No image augmentation techniques were applied.
